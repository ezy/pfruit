	<p>Passionfruit is a company that was founded by <a href="http://ezra.keddell.co.nz" target="_blank">Ezra Keddell</a> in Wellington in 2010 with the goal of helping small businesses present a professional quality web presence online. In a little over 2 years Ezra built over 70 websites under the <a href="http://wellingtonweb.co.nz">wellingtonweb.co.nz</a> sub brand, with the average client investment being returned to them within 12 months. </p>
	<p>In 2012, Ezra started contracting out his UX/UI Design and Front End Development skills to some of New Zealand's best companies under the brand. In that time he has worked for Xero, Vodafone, Yellow and 3Months (to name a few) on large scale Corporate and Government projects.</p>
	<p>2015 brings a new chapter as the company grows and adapts to the web sphere. In October of 2014 Ezra embarked on bootstrapping 3 different start-up projects. The company goal for the medium term is to develop these products into first class applications in their respective fields. We're also on the lookout to partner with like minded people who have a good history in a different field other than ICT, and are passionate about what they do. We're looking to build on the solid reputation of New Zealand ICT, and build online products and services that add to the pool of first class products we're producing in this fine country.</p>
	<p>We have a unique opportunity in this small piece of Godzone down at the bottom of the planet. What if I told you that there was a product that costs nothing to produce except time? And that same product can then be scaled almost infinitely, and delivered instantaneously to the customers that are wanting it. If the customers like the product, they can effortlessly tell their friends about it with a single click of a mouse. Those customers make up the largest market place in the world where a niche can be upwards of 3 million people. Hell, you'd probably tell me it's the perfect opportunity for a country like ours down at the arse end of the world. And you'd be right, it bloody well is. And right now the opportunity, enjoyment and potential financial reward in this industry is pretty astronomical.</p>

<!-- 	<h3>A word from Ezra</h3>
	<p>I'm lazy and easily distracted. Growing up, I got easily frustrated if I couldn't see a clear benefit to the outcome of what I was doing. If there's an easier way to do something I'll look into it. And if that way delivers a better outcome I'll adopt it. Over the last 4 years, having had the privilege to deliver work for a range of NZ's best online companies, I've seen first hand how they deliver web software. I've fallen in love with some of the technology that I've worked with - Ruby on Rails, SASS, Slim and Haml, Html5, AngularJS and many of the other JS libraries and frameworks bringing so much w!n to the web at the moment. And now is the time to take that experience and start crafting my own story.</p> -->
